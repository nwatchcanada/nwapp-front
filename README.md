This project is uses ``django-tenants`` library and is setup to work with multiple domains. As a result, we will need to bind the address **workery.ca** to your ``localhost``. To do this follow these instructions.

1. Update your hosts file to support our applications domain.

  ```
  sudo vi /etc/hosts
  ```

2. Append to the file...

  ```
  127.0.0.1       public.localhost
  127.0.0.1       london.localhost
  127.0.0.1       toronto.localhost
  127.0.0.1       sub1.localhost
  127.0.0.1       sub2.localhost
  ```


3. Refresh the dns on your machine to support our new domains.

  ```
  dscacheutil -flushcache
  ```
